## 🎯 Focus

I believe in prioritization that is honest about impact and capability. There is a parable I share on how to achieve your goals: write down twenty-five things you want to accomplish in life and then cross off twenty of them. Those are distractions. The backlog is not the good idea log and the roadmap should be clear.
